            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Vivian and I've been an ARMY since the start of
              2024. My current biases are Namjoon and Yoongi. As a developer, I
              love incorporating my passion for BTS into my work, whether by
              adding their content or listening to their music while I code.
